# Campus Placement Prediction Model using Ensemble Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Campus Placement Prediction Model using Ensemble Learning project! This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed in a campus recruitment drive based on various factors and features. Campus placement is a crucial event in the life of a student, and this model can assist both students and educational institutions in making informed decisions.

Ensemble Learning techniques combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy and robustness. In this project, we use popular ensemble techniques to build a powerful predictive model for campus placement.

## Dataset

We have used a dataset containing information about students, including their academic scores, communication skills, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

You can find the dataset used in this project here.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

## Usage

To use the Campus Placement Prediction Model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (see the Installation section).
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook campus_placement_prediction.ipynb.
Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the ensemble models, and make predictions.
Analyze the results and evaluate the model's performance.
Models

We have implemented the following ensemble learning models for campus placement prediction:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Voting Classifier (Combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost)
You can explore the individual model implementations in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of our models using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC AUC
You can find the detailed evaluation results and visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook.
